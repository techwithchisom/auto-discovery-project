My goal was to create a scalable, secure, and highly available pet adoption application. I began by designing the infrastructure using Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. With Terraform, I defined the desired state of the AWS resources through declarative configuration files. This approach allowed me to version control the infrastructure and reproduce it consistently across different environments.

Once the infrastructure design was in place, I focused on developing the application code and creating Dockerfiles to package the application components into containers. Containerization was a key aspect of the project, as it ensured consistency across environments and simplified the deployment and scaling processes. I stored the application code and Dockerfiles in a GitHub repository, leveraging its version control capabilities.

To automate the build and deployment processes, I set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. I configured Jenkins to trigger the pipeline whenever changes were pushed to the GitHub repository. The pipeline started with a code analysis stage using SonarQube, a static code analysis tool. SonarQube helped me maintain code quality, identify potential issues, and ensure the application adhered to best practices and security standards. If the code passed the quality gates, the pipeline proceeded to build the application artifacts and Docker images.

I utilized Nexus, an artifact repository manager, to store and manage the built application artifacts. Nexus provided a centralized location for versioning and distributing the artifacts. For the Docker images, I pushed them to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), a fully managed Docker container registry provided by AWS. ECR offered secure storage and easy retrieval of the images during the deployment process.

After the successful completion of the CI stages, the pipeline automatically triggered the deployment to the staging environment. I leveraged Ansible, an infrastructure automation tool, to define the deployment tasks through playbooks. Ansible playbooks allowed me to automate the deployment process, including stopping existing containers, pulling the latest Docker images from ECR, and starting new containers with the updated application version. The Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the staging environment was updated to route traffic to the newly deployed containers.

To ensure the application's functionality and performance, I incorporated automated testing into the pipeline. If the tests passed successfully, the pipeline moved forward. However, if any tests failed, the pipeline would halt, and I would investigate and resolve the issues promptly. This automated testing process helped me catch bugs early and maintain the application's quality.

Before deploying to production, I implemented a manual approval step in the pipeline. As the sole developer, I reviewed the changes thoroughly and gave the green light for production deployment only when I was confident in the application's readiness.

Once the manual approval was obtained, the pipeline triggered the deployment to the production environment. I used Ansible playbooks to automate the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reliability. The ALB in the production environment was updated to route traffic to the newly deployed containers seamlessly.

Monitoring and logging were crucial components of the Auto Discovery project. I integrated New Relic, a powerful application performance monitoring tool, to gain insights into the application's performance, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot any issues that arose. Additionally, I utilized AWS CloudWatch and the ELK stack to collect and analyze logs from both the application and the infrastructure. These monitoring and logging solutions enabled me to proactively detect and resolve issues, ensuring a smooth user experience.

To ensure high availability and scalability, I leveraged AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) in both the staging and production environments. ASGs automatically adjusted the number of EC2 instances based on the incoming traffic load, scaling up when demand increased and scaling down when demand decreased. This automatic scaling capability allowed the application to handle varying levels of traffic seamlessly and cost-effectively.

I also implemented a multi-AZ deployment for the RDS database, with a primary instance and a backup instance in separate Availability Zones. This setup ensured data durability and minimized downtime in case of any issues with the primary database instance.

Security was a top priority throughout the project. I integrated Vault, a secrets management tool, to securely store and manage sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys. By leveraging Terraform's integration with Vault, I could retrieve secrets securely during the infrastructure provisioning process, ensuring that sensitive information was not exposed in plain text.

One of the key aspects of the Auto Discovery project was the adherence to infrastructure as code (IaC) principles. By defining the infrastructure using Terraform and automating deployments with Ansible, I achieved consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments. This approach reduced the risk of human error, accelerated the deployment process, and enabled version control of the infrastructure code.

Throughout the project, I focused on creating a cohesive and efficient workflow by integrating various tools and technologies. From infrastructure provisioning with Terraform to containerization with Docker, CI/CD with Jenkins, and infrastructure automation with Ansible, each tool played a crucial role in the overall solution. The seamless integration of these tools allowed for a streamlined development and deployment process.

The Auto Discovery project showcases my ability to single-handedly design and implement a modern, scalable, and secure application architecture. By leveraging industry best practices and a comprehensive set of tools, I created a robust solution that ensures high availability, scalability, and reliability. The project's unique combination of containerization, infrastructure as code, and security measures sets it apart and demonstrates my expertise in building complex systems.
